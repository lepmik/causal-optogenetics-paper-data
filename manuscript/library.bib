abstract = {Neural interface technology has made enormous strides in recent years but stimulating electrodes remain incapable of reliably targeting specific cell types (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory neurons) within neural tissue. This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is genetically targetable, specific populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the first in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface (ONI) in intact animals, involving integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 mW of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, flexible multimode optical fiber, approximately 200 microm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we specifically targeted ChR2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the CaMKIIalpha promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the fiber ( approximately 380 mW mm(-2)) was sufficient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial finding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may find application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.},

abstract = {Unitary EPSPs were evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurons by activation of single CA3 pyramidal neurons. Seventy-one EPSPs were recorded. The peak amplitudes of these EPSPs ranged from 30 to 665 microV with a mean of 131 microV. Rise times and half-widths were measured, the means +/- SD being 3.9 +/- 1.8 and 19.5 +/- 8.0 msec, respectively. The time courses of these EPSPs were consistent with a brief synaptic current at a localized electrotonic region of the dendritic tree followed by passive spread of current to the soma. EPSPs varied in amplitude from trial to trial. Sufficient records were collected for 12 EPSPs to demonstrate that this variation was greater than could be accounted for by baseline noise. The amplitude variations of one EPSP were reliably resolved from the background noise, and this EPSP fluctuated between 4 discrete amplitudes (including failures) separated by a quantal increment of 278 microV.},

abstract = {Synaptic transmission between pairs of neurons in layer 2/3 of in vitro slices from the rat visual cortex was studied by dual intracellular recording. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of these neurons suggested that they were pyramidal cells. More than 1/3 of the total number of synaptically connected neurons were stained by intracellular iontophoresis of biocytin, and all had pyramidal morphology. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were evoked by single action potentials (elicited by current injection) in presynaptic cells. Measurements of PSP latency, amplitude, and shape were made on spike-triggered averages. Forty-eight synaptic connections were found out of a possible total of 549, equivalent to a probability of about 0.09. For these 48 connections, the distance between the 2 impalement sites ranged from 50 to 340 microns. All PSPs were depolarizing at rest (-74 +/- 5 mV, mean +/- SD), and all 14 of the PSPs that were also recorded with the postsynaptic cell depolarized to around action potential threshold (about -55 mV) remained depolarizing. PSPs had short latencies (1.2 +/- 0.6 msec, mean +/- SD), suggesting that they were mediated by monosynaptic pathways. Peak amplitudes of the averaged PSPs varied widely (range, 0.05-2.08 mV), but the majority were less than 0.5 mV. PSPs decayed exponentially with time constants that were correlated with, but slightly longer than, the membrane time constants of the postsynaptic cells measured using injected current pulses. Four cell pairs were connected reciprocally, and 6 examples of convergent input were found in which a single cell was postsynaptic to more than 1 presynaptic cell. Trial-to-trial fluctuations in PSP amplitude were analyzed for 16 synaptic connections. The amplitude of the PSP evoked by a presynaptic action potential fluctuated more than could be accounted for by the background noise.},

abstract = {Excitatory control of inhibitory neurons is poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying synaptic connectivity inÂ vivo. We inferred such connectivity through analysis of spike timing and validated this inference using juxtacellular and optogenetic control of presynaptic spikes in behaving mice. We observed that neighboring CA1 neurons had stronger connections and that superficial pyramidal cells projected more to deep interneurons. Connection probability and strength were skewed, with a minority of highly connected hubs. Divergent presynaptic connections led to synchrony between interneurons. Synchrony of convergent presynaptic inputs boosted postsynaptic drive. Presynaptic firing frequency was read out by postsynaptic neurons through short-term depression and facilitation, with individual pyramidal cells and interneurons displaying a diversity of spike transmission filters. Additionally, spike transmission was strongly modulated by prior spike timing of the postsynaptic cell. These results bridge anatomical structure with physiological function.},

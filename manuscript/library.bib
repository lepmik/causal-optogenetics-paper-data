abstract = {There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, enabled by data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. Here we take a simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the processor. This suggests that current approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful models of the brain.},

abstract = {Unitary EPSPs were evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurons by activation of single CA3 pyramidal neurons. Seventy-one EPSPs were recorded. The peak amplitudes of these EPSPs ranged from 30 to 665 microV with a mean of 131 microV. Rise times and half-widths were measured, the means +/- SD being 3.9 +/- 1.8 and 19.5 +/- 8.0 msec, respectively. The time courses of these EPSPs were consistent with a brief synaptic current at a localized electrotonic region of the dendritic tree followed by passive spread of current to the soma. EPSPs varied in amplitude from trial to trial. Sufficient records were collected for 12 EPSPs to demonstrate that this variation was greater than could be accounted for by baseline noise. The amplitude variations of one EPSP were reliably resolved from the background noise, and this EPSP fluctuated between 4 discrete amplitudes (including failures) separated by a quantal increment of 278 microV.},

@article{Mason1991,
abstract = {Synaptic transmission between pairs of neurons in layer 2/3 of in vitro slices from the rat visual cortex was studied by dual intracellular recording. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of these neurons suggested that they were pyramidal cells. More than 1/3 of the total number of synaptically connected neurons were stained by intracellular iontophoresis of biocytin, and all had pyramidal morphology. Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) were evoked by single action potentials (elicited by current injection) in presynaptic cells. Measurements of PSP latency, amplitude, and shape were made on spike-triggered averages. Forty-eight synaptic connections were found out of a possible total of 549, equivalent to a probability of about 0.09. For these 48 connections, the distance between the 2 impalement sites ranged from 50 to 340 microns. All PSPs were depolarizing at rest (-74 +/- 5 mV, mean +/- SD), and all 14 of the PSPs that were also recorded with the postsynaptic cell depolarized to around action potential threshold (about -55 mV) remained depolarizing. PSPs had short latencies (1.2 +/- 0.6 msec, mean +/- SD), suggesting that they were mediated by monosynaptic pathways. Peak amplitudes of the averaged PSPs varied widely (range, 0.05-2.08 mV), but the majority were less than 0.5 mV. PSPs decayed exponentially with time constants that were correlated with, but slightly longer than, the membrane time constants of the postsynaptic cells measured using injected current pulses. Four cell pairs were connected reciprocally, and 6 examples of convergent input were found in which a single cell was postsynaptic to more than 1 presynaptic cell. Trial-to-trial fluctuations in PSP amplitude were analyzed for 16 synaptic connections. The amplitude of the PSP evoked by a presynaptic action potential fluctuated more than could be accounted for by the background noise.},

abstract = {We studied the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons with conductance-based (nonlinear) synapses and compared them to networks with current-based (linear) synapses. For systems with sparse and inhibition-dominated recurrent connectivity, weak external inputs induced asynchronous irregular firing at low rates. Membrane potentials fluctuated a few millivolts below threshold, and membrane conductances were increased by a factor 2 to 5 with respect to the resting state. This combination of parameters characterizes the ongoing spiking activity typically recorded in the cortex in vivo. Many aspects of the asynchronous irregular state in conductance-based networks could be sufficiently well characterized with a simple numerical mean field approach. In particular, it correctly predicted an intriguing property of conductance-based networks that does not appear to be shared by current-based models: they exhibit states of low-rate asynchronous irregular activity that persist for some period of time even in t...},

abstract = {Excitatory control of inhibitory neurons is poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying synaptic connectivity in vivo. We inferred such connectivity through analysis of spike timing and validated this inference using juxtacellular and optogenetic control of presynaptic spikes in behaving mice. We observed that neighboring CA1 neurons had stronger connections and that superficial pyramidal cells projected more to deep interneurons. Connection probability and strength were skewed, with a minority of highly connected hubs. Divergent presynaptic connections led to synchrony between interneurons. Synchrony of convergent presynaptic inputs boosted postsynaptic drive. Presynaptic firing frequency was read out by postsynaptic neurons through short-term depression and facilitation, with individual pyramidal cells and interneurons displaying a diversity of spike transmission filters. Additionally, spike transmission was strongly modulated by prior spike timing of the postsynaptic cell. These results bridge anatomical structure with physiological function.},
